# Frontend Optimization Suggestions

## Code Splitting
- Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level code splitting
- Split routes into separate chunks
- Use dynamic imports for large libraries

## Performance Optimizations
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useCallback
- Implement virtualization for long lists (react-window or react-virtualized)

## Asset Optimization
- Optimize images using WebP format and responsive sizes
- Lazy load images and components below the fold
- Implement font display swap for text visibility during font loading

## State Management
- Consider using Context API for simpler state management
- Implement proper state normalization to avoid duplication
- Use local state for UI-only state that doesn't need to be shared

## Build Optimization
- Enable source maps only in development
- Implement tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- Configure proper chunking strategy in webpack
